## 🚗 Automotive Pricing Analysis

**Description:**  
This project focuses on analyzing automotive sales and pricing trends to optimize revenue and identify high-value customer segments. I built **regression and tree-based models** to predict purchase likelihood and determine optimal pricing strategies. By exploring feature importance and model outputs, I extracted actionable insights to inform marketing and sales decisions, helping the business maximize profitability and target the right customer groups.

**Key Features:**
- Forecasted sales and pricing impact using regression modeling
- Built Decision Tree and Random Forest models for customer segmentation
- Conducted feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of purchase behavior
- Created data visualizations to communicate trends and insights

**Skills & Tools:**  
Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Decision Trees | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting| Matplotlib | Seaborn

**Folder / Notebook:**  
[`AutomotivePricingAnalysis/`](./AutomotivePricingAnalysis) – Contains all data cleaning, analysis, modeling scripts, and visualizations

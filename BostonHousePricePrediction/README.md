# Boston House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project applies statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in the Boston metropolitan area. Beyond prediction accuracy, the primary objective was to understand *which factors most strongly influence housing value* and how these insights can inform investment, planning, and policy decisions.

Housing markets are influenced by a complex interaction of socioeconomic, structural, and environmental variables. This analysis treats housing prices as a systems-level outcome rather than a purely numerical target, emphasizing interpretability alongside performance.

## Business Question
How accurately can housing prices be predicted using structured data, and which features meaningfully drive price variation across neighborhoods?

## Analytical Approach
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to assess feature distributions, correlations, and potential multicollinearity
- Built baseline regression models to establish interpretability and performance benchmarks
- Applied machine learning models to improve predictive accuracy
- Evaluated models using appropriate error and goodness-of-fit metrics
- Interpreted feature importance to identify key price drivers

## Tools & Techniques
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Regression and machine learning models
- Model evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- Multicollinearity Check (Variance Inflation Factors Analysis)

## Key Insights
- A small subset of neighborhood and environmental features explained a large portion of price variability.
- Machine learning models improved accuracy while still allowing for interpretability.
- Results demonstrate how predictive analytics can support data-driven decision-making in real estate and urban planning contexts.

## Portfolio Projects

### 1. Boston House Price Prediction
Leveraged machine learning and regression modeling to forecast housing prices, uncover key price drivers, and enhance investment insights.  Techniques include VIF analysis, log transformations, Ridge/Lasso/Random Forest/CatBoost models, and GridSearchCV optimization.

**Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Variance Inflation Factor ( assesing multicollinearity in the ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis ) and Matplotlib.  
**Folder:** `BostonHousePricePrediction/`

---

### 2. Automotive Pricing Analysis
Applied regression and tree-based models to identify key customer segments and optimize pricing strategies.  
**Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decission Tree, Lasso, Linear Regression), Hyperparameter Tuning, Pandas, Seaborn.
**Folder:** `AutomotivePricingAnalysis/`

---

### 3. Business Data Analysis: Restaurant Demand Forecasting
Optimized restaurant performance using SQL and Python to identify customer demand trends.  
**Tools:** SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. 
**Folder:** `RestaurantDemandForecasting/`

---

### 4. Vaccine Marketing Strategy: N1H1
Developed strategies to optimize target marketing for the N1H1 vaccine by analyzing demographic and behavioral data, ensuring efficient resource allocation.  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression using SMOTE), Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search), Seaborn.
**Folder:** `N1H1VaccineMarketing/`

---

### 5. Pneumonia X-ray Detection
Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) for medical image classification to identify pneumonia cases from X-ray images.  
**Tools:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Hyperparameter tuning.
**Folder:** `PneumoniaXrayDetection/`

---

### 6. Pharmaceutical Program Adoption Analysis
Analyzed program adoption data to optimize marketing strategies and improve uptake metrics for a pharmaceutical drug using advanced analytics techniques.  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas,Scikit-learn ( Random Forest, XGboost, Linear Regression, Lasos, Decision Tree, SHAP, PDP), Cross-validation, Regression Modeling and Data Visualization.  
**Folder:** `PharmaProgramAdoption/`

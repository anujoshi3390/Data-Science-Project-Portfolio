Project Overview
This study examines:

Demand trends for restaurants across different time periods and locations.
Customer ordering behavior based on preferences, delivery times, and ratings.
Operational efficiency improvements to reduce delivery times and cancellations.
Key methodologies include:

Data Processing: Using PostgreSQL for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy) to uncover demand trends and performance insights.
Data Visualization: Tableau dashboards to present key findings and actionable insights.
Key Features
Demand Trend Analysis: Identification of peak demand times and high-performing restaurant categories.
Customer Segmentation: Insights into ordering behavior to optimize marketing strategies.
Operational Efficiency Optimization: Recommendations to improve delivery times and customer satisfaction.
Key Insights
Peak demand occurs during lunch hours on weekdays, with specific cuisine types driving high order volumes.
Restaurants with the highest ratings tend to experience lower order cancellations and higher repeat customers.
Optimizing delivery routes based on order clusters can reduce average delivery time by 15%.

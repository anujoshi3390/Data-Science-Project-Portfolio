# Pharmaceutical Program Adoption Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes adoption patterns for a pharmaceutical program to understand what drives participation, sustained engagement and inform marketing target stratiges. Pharmaceutical programs often struggle with underutilization, even when clinical value is high.

The analysis frames adoption as a systems problem involving awareness, access, and behavior—rather than a purely clinical outcome.

## Business Question
What factors influence pharmaceutical program adoption, and how can analytics support improved participation and outcomes?

## Tools & Techniques
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Predictive modeling (Random Forest, XGboost, SHAP, PDP)
- Adoption and engagement metrics

## Key Insights
- Adoption is influenced by both structural and behavioral factors
- Predictive analytics enables more efficient and targeted outreach
- Highlights the role of analytics in improving healthcare program effectiveness
